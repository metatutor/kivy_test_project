Commands you should know:

To check the repository for new code (if I made any changes):
	git pull

To commit any changes you made to files that are currently in the project:
	git commit -am "insert a message here"

To send those changes you've already committed above to Github:
	git push

If you ever add any files to the project (for whatever reason):
	git add <filename>

Confused about what's included in the project?
	git status
